# a long signal is divided into (n_window*2 - 1) section
# average only occurs on the time dimension, without on spanwise dimension
# output includs n_points	48 curves


# attention
# 3 sections + 2 overlaps
# total points < 2**(n_order-1)*(n_window*2 - 1) = 2**11 * 3

# total points should = 2**n_order*n_window


# how to define n_window
# if n_window is too large, the maximum period will be vert small, the minimum frequency will be very laege
# n_window depend on practical condition and the time period which is already calculated
